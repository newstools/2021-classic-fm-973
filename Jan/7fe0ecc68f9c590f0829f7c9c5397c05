West Ham are leading the race to sign England midfielder Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United. There has been interest in Lingard from elsewhere but the Hammers are best placed if they can make the deal work. A move away from Old Trafford will be sanctioned given, considering his struggle to break into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side this season.  However, any deal would require West Ham to sign either Craig Dawson or Said Benrahma on a permanent basis. The Premier League rules permits clubs to have only a maximum of two domestic loan signings within their squad. Dawson and Benrahma moved to London Stadium on loan from Championship sides Watford and Brentford respectively in October.  West Ham manager David Moyes took Lingard on tour in 2013 during his only summer as United boss. The midfielder scored the first goal of what turned out to be the Scot's ill-fated time in charge, during a game against the A-League All Stars in Sydney.
