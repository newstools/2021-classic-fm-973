AC Milan have signed Croatian Mario Mandzukic on a free transfer until the end of the season, with the option for an extra year.  The former Juventus striker, 34, has been without a club since leaving Qatari club Al Duhail last summer. He was a Champions League winner with Bayern Munich in 2013, won four Serie A titles with Juventus from 2015 and 2019 and also played for Atletico Madrid. Mandzukic scored as Croatia lost 4-2 to France in the 2018 World Cup final.  New team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic, told Sky Sport Italia on Monday "I am very happy". "There will be two of us to scare the opponents now."
