President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his administration will work to eliminate food inflation in the New Year.  Speaking at the fifth regular meeting with the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, at the Presidential Villa Tuesday in Abuja, President Buhari directed that the CBN must not give money to import food, noting that about seven states are producing all the rice that Nigeria requires. The President, who further noted the strides made in agricultural production, wondered what the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would have been on the country, if it had not embraced agriculture.  Our Correspondent reports that the meeting, which was to review the global and domestic economy in the outgoing year, noted the sharp deterioration in international economic environment and its impact on Nigeria’s economic recovery. It emphasized the need to make the private sector of the economy the primary source of investment, rather than government.  The meeting equally agreed to prepare the country for the challenges ahead, especially to attain Macro-economic stability, create certainty and re-build investor confidence in the economy as well as deepen structural reforms initiated by the federal government.
