In a bid to address the incessant clashes in the country between farmers and cattle herders, the Chairman Ranchers Owners Association & Chairman National Interest Forum Alhaji Mohammed Kabiru Shittu has called on the Federal Government to create an enabling environment for ranching in the country.  In an interview on Classic fm Abuja, Alhaji Shittu while using Bayelsa state as a case study, mentioned that creating ranches in states can help address the insecurity in some states and provide jobs for youths in the country, adding that the quit notice by some State Governors would not address the recurring crisis.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the Chairman further said governments can take advantage of technology and create a database that will help regulate and control the movement of cattle rearers in the states.  He further reiterated that when state governments are able to bring these cattle herders together, they will be asked to pay for the land they are grazing on and even pay taxes which will serve as revenue generation for the state.
