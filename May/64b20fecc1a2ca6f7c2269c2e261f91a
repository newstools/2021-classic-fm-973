The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in its effort to ensure all Nigerians are vaccinated, revealed that a total of 1,92MillionÂ Nigerians, representing 96% of the targeted population have received first dose of the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine.  The Executive Director, (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib who made this known today as the agency gives update on Covid 19 vaccination in Abuja also disclosed that over 4 thousand people have already received their second doses, in line with the guideline of administering the two doses between six and 12 weeks of each other, calling on all Nigerians who have received their first doses to check their vaccination cards for the date of their second dose.  Dr Faisal however noted that the Federal Government is unsure when it will receive the next batch of COVID-19 vaccine to administer to more Nigerians, adding that the government expects that the recent promises made by Pfizer/BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson to provide a combined 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to COVAX between now and next year should ease the situation.  Giving an update on the B.1.617.2, known as the Indian variant, he said the Federal Government is concerned about the variant and is taking serious precautions to ensure Nigerians are safe.
