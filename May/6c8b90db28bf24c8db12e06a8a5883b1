The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Joint Task Force (JTF) has demolished a Fulani Ruga settlement located very close to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.  Mr Ikharo Attah, Chairman, FCT Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation, who disclosed this on Sunday in Abuja, said this was due to contravention of sanitation regulations. He explained that the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, had expressed displeasure over the continuing contravention on in and out-bounds of the roads, noting that the Airport road was a major gateway to the city centre of the nation’s capital and therefore all occupants would have to comply to rules and regulations.  He disclosed that the minister, who visited the affected areas two months ago with key stakeholders, had held consultations with both residents and community leaders to sensitise them on the need to remove all the contravention. He added that two months notice was given to the affected people, but no compliance was recorded, hence the demolition actions taken.
