The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has recorded 41 deliberate attacks on its facilities across the country within the last two years.  INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this at the commission’s emergency meeting with security agencies under the auspices of the Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), in Abuja said the attacks on the commission’s facilities should now be treated as a national security emergency. He stressed the need to work together with the security agencies, to stop these attacks and the wanton destruction of critical electoral assets.  Our Correspondent reports that the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (Rtd.) who is also Co-Chair of ICCES, said his office was working with other agencies to collaborate with INEC to sustain Nigeria democracy and the will of the people.
