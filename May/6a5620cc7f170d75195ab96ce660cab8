The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has retained the monetary policy rate at 11.5 percent, the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 percent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 percent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.  Briefing journalists Wednesday, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, who disclosed this at the end of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting in Abuja, explained that the move is expected to allow further economic growth, amidst rising inflation.  Responding to questions on the CBN ban on cryptocurrency transactions in Nigerian banks, the CBN governor insisted that the encrypted nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes it hard for fraud to be investigated and criminals apprehended, adding that the Apex Bank will sustain its efforts on the FOREX market.  The CBN Governor said that the Apex Bank is engaging with the National Economic Council to ensure that States pay back their intervention loans, as well as noting that the incentives to encourage Diaspora remittances will continue.
