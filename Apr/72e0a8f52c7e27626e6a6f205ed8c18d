Meanwhile, in response to the global shortfall of COVID-19 vaccines and the late commencement of the vaccination in some States, the NPHCDA said it is expanding the eligibility period between the first and second doses of the vaccine from 12 weeks to 8 to 12 weeks. The agency said the move is in line with the scientific recommendation provided by the WHO’s  Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, SAGE, on immunisation that the two doses of the vaccine be given at  8-12 weeks intervals.
