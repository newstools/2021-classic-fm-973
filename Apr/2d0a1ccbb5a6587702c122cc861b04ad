Legislative Aides under the auspices of the "Concerned National Assembly Legislative Aides Forum, (NASSLAF) Tuesday protested at the foyer of the National Assembly over unpaid salary arrears.  Bearing placards with varying inscriptions and chanting solidarity songs at the foyer, the Aides led by Chairman of NASSLAF, Mr Salisu Zuru, presenting their demands to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, appealed to the Speaker to prevail on the National Assembly Clerk for refusing to pay about 2,500 aides their 2019 salary arrears.  He further noted that the union may as a last resort approach the National Industrial Court to ensure their entitlements are paid.Â Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that some of the demands, according to the Protesters include non-payment of the routine Duty Tour Allowance (DTA), lack of training, non-implementation of National Minimum Wage and the Consolidated Legislative Aides Salary Structure (CONLESS).  In his remarks, after receiving the letter of demand, Gbajabiamila, who noted that non-payment of salaries was inexcusable, assured the protesters that their grievances will be looked into.
