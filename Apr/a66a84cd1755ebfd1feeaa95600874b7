The Senate, Tuesday, upon resumption from its two weeks recess, adjourned plenary till Wednesday, 14th March, 2021, over the recent death of two members of the National Assembly.  This was just as the Upper Chamber held a minute silence in honour of both lawmakers who are members of the House of Representatives. The decision to suspend plenary was carried out in line with the tradition of the National Assembly, following a motion moved by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, and seconded by the Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe.  President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, while putting the motion to a voice vote which was unanimously supported by Senators, described the demise of the two lawmakers as another sad development in the National Assembly.  Recall that Hon. Haruna Ibrahim Maitala, who represented Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State and Hon. Suleiman Aliyu Lere, who represented Lere Federal constituency of Kaduna State in the House of Representatives, died on Friday, April 2, 2021 and Tuesday, April 6, 2021 respectively.
