The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has described as untrue and sad, the comment by the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki that the Federal Government printed N60 billion in March to support federal allocation to states.  Fielding questions from State House correspondents today in Abuja, Mrs Ahmed explained that what is distributed at the monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meetings were generated revenue from government institutions, available to the public on the ministry’s website.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Minister said despite Governor Obaseki’s worry on the rising debt profile of the country and that Nigeria is in ‘huge financial crisis’, his submission is unnecessary as the country’s debt is still within sustainable threshold at 23% to GDP.  Recall that the Edo Governor was quoted as saying at the Edo transition committee stakeholders engagement last week Saturday that, “When we got FAAC for March, the federal government printed additional N50-N60 billion to top-up for us to share. “This April, we will go to Abuja and share. By the end of this year, our total borrowings are going to be within N15-N16 trillion.”
