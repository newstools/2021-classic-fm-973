Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state has reacted to the federal government's denial of his earlier claim of printing up to N50-60 billion for state governments to share in the month of March.  In a statement shared on his official website, Governor Obaseki said he does not want to join issues with the Federal Ministry of Finance as he believes it is their duty to offer useful advice for the benefit of the country.  Appealing to the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed to rally Nigerians to stem the "obvious fiscal slide" facing the country, Obaseki urged the federal government to ''stop playing the ostrich but rather take urgent steps to end the current monetary rascality to prevent the prevailing economic challenge from degenerating further.''  He added that they "believe it is imperative to approach the Nigerian project with all sense of responsibility and commitment and not play to the gallery because ultimately, time shall be the judge of us all.
