In an effort to reduce the use of illicit drugs in the country, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is seeking close collaboration with the Nigeria Army in combating the drug menace in the country.  The Chairman/Chief Executive NDLEA, Brig Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (rtd) during a courtesy visit to the Army Headquarters in Abuja, stated that over 15 million Nigerians use illicit drugs, adding that bandits and Boko Haram are also in high use of drugs to boost their moral to carry out their dastard attacks on innocent citizens.  In his remarks the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru while commending the NDLEA for its efforts in ridding the country of harmful drugs, said the Nigerian Army under his watch has zero tolerance for illicit use of drugs across the country.
