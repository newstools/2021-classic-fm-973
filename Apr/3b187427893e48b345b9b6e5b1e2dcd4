The Nigerian Senate is advocating for stiffer penalties for anyone caught in possession of firearms not legally procured in Nigeria.Â This came to the fore during a presentation at a one-day public hearing on a bill to curb the proliferation of illegal arms in the country organised by Senate Joint committees on Judiciary, Navy and Marine Transport at National Assembly Complex today in Abuja.  In his remarks, the sponsor of the Firearms Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill, Senator Uba Sani, says the aim of the proposed amendments is to curtail the proliferation of illegal arms and effectively address some of the security challenges currently plaguing Nigeria.  Earlier in his speech, the Chairman of the Senate Joint Committee on Judiciary, Navy and Marine Transport, Senator Bamidele Opeyemi submitted that it is necessary to put legislative measures in place to address the proliferation of illegal firearms in the country in view of the rising spate of armed robbery, armed banditry, insurgency and insecurity, generally across the country.  Other stakeholders at the event, Admiral Adeseye Oke-ayobanjo-Representing Chief of Naval Staff and Brig. Gen. Mamhood Omaru Representing Chief of Army Staff also made their reservations on the proliferation of firearms in Nigeria.
