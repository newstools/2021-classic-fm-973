Arsenal legends Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira have joined Spotify founder and billionaire Daniel Ek's bid to buy the club.  Owner Stan Kroenke has no intention to sell, but more than 1,000 fans protested outside Emirates Stadium on Friday calling for him to quit.  Arsenal had announced they were one of 12 founding members of the European Super League the previous Sunday. But just 48 hours later, they withdrew and apologised to fans.  Kroenke's son, Josh, told an Arsenal fans forum on Thursday that his family have no intention of selling and promised to engage with fans in future - he refused to answer a question about their exit strategy, responding: "I'm not willing to answer that question because we have no intention of selling."  On Friday, Swedish businessman Ek, 38, who is worth a reported 4.7 billion US dollars (£3.38bn) tweeted: "As a kid growing up, I've cheered for Arsenal as long as I can remember. If KSE would like to sell Arsenal I'd be happy to throw my hat in the ring."
