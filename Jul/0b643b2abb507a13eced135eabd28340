The Senate Tuesday confirmed the appointment of five nominees as Commissioners of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), just as it rejected the nomination of Lauretta Onochie (Delta) and stepped down that of Prof. Sani Muhammad Adam (North Central) for further investigation by the committee.  The confirmation of the nominees followed the consideration of a report presented by the Senate Committee on INEC, Chairman, Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano South), who said the Committee received several petitions against the nominations of Ms. Lauretta Onochie and Professor Sani Muhammad Adam. Those confirmed include Professor Abdullahi Abdu Zuru (North-West), Prof. Muhammad Sani Kallah (Katsina), Prof. Kunle Cornelius Ajayi (Ekiti), Dr. Baba Bila (North-East), and Saidu Babura Ahmad (Jigawa).  Senator Kabiru Gaya also disclosed that the petitions against Lauretta Onochie were against the backdrop that her involvement in politics and alleged membership of a political party, adding that her nomination violated the Federal Character Principle as there is already a serving National Electoral Commissioner from Delta State, Barr. Mary Agbamuche-Mbu who was screened and confirmed by the 8th Senate.  Accordingly, the Senate while confirming the five nominees, adopted the recommendations of the Committee by rejecting Onochie’s nomination and stepping down that of Professor Adam for further action.
