Bill Cosby walked out of a Pennsylvania prison on Wednesday after serving over two years for a sexual assault conviction.  According to the Associated Press, Pennsylvania’s highest court overturned the conviction after finding an agreement with a previous prosecutor prevented him from being charged in the case. Cosby had vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse over an alleged encounter with accuser Andrea Constand, who says the 83-year-old drugged and molested her at his suburban estate in 2004.  As social media erupted with reactions, Timbaland quickly felt the heat after he shared an Instagram post seemingly joking about Cosby’s impending release with an old Jello Pudding Pops ad featuring the former Cosby Show actor. “Who wants a a jello pudding pop,” he wrote in the caption. “I’m home now.” Twitter soon lit up with reactions to Timbaland’s post, with many accusing the legendary producer of having a similar predatory vibe.  As one person wrote, “Timbaland supporting Bill Cosby is not surprising cause he had an odd obsession with Aaliyah that veered into predatory behavior. He’s one of them.” Another added, “Timbaland post some creepy shit like that but a few months later it’s ‘RIP baby girl’ like a predator wasn’t also at the center of her life,” referring to the currently incarcerated R. Kelly. But Timbaland wasn’t the only one seemingly celebrating Cosby’s newfound freedom. Big Freedia, Lil Duval, Ice-T and T.I. also commented on the new development, angering some people in the process.  2021 marked the first year Cosby was eligible for parole under the three- to 10-year sentence handed down after his 2018 conviction. Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt called the parole board decision “appalling.” Prosecutors said Cosby repeatedly used his fame and “family man” persona to manipulate young women, holding himself out as a mentor before taking advantage of him.
