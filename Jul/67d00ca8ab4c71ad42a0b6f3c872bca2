The highly anticipated Electoral Act Amendment bill 2021 report, was Wednesday laid before the Senate at plenary by the Chairman of the Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabiru Gaya. The Senate is expected to debate the report on Thursday before it proceeds on its annual recess.  President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has kicked against what he described as the ‘calculated blackmail’ against the leadership of the National Assembly over the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, presently before both chambers. Lawan in his remarks after a report on the bill was laid before the upper chamber, advised Nigerians to lobby lawmakers on any aspect of the bill they feel strongly about, insisting that the National Assembly would do only what is right when it eventually considers the bill.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Senate President, however, maintained that the National Assembly can only consider aspects of the amendment bill contained in the Committee’s report presented to the upper chamber for consideration.
