The Nigerian Senate has approved a loan request of N2.34 trillion ($6.183 billion USD) as External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act. The loan was approved following the consideration of the report of the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts at plenary as presented by Chairman of the committee, Senator Clifford Ordia. In his presentation, Senator Ordia said the request is not new as it had already been approved in the borrowing plan when the National Assembly passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill.  After the approval, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the National Assembly must make sure that there are no frivolous expenditures by the executive and the loan will be used to fund projects from priority sectors of the economy namely: power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, education, health, provision of counterpart funding for multilateral and bilateral projects, defence and water resources.
