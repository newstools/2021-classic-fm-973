Leicester have signed Zambian striker Patson Daka from RB Salzburg on a five-year-deal, thought to be worth £22m.  Leicester confirmed in a statement that the "exciting young striker" will join the club "from 1 July, subject to Premier League and international clearance"  "It is the perfect place for me because it's a team that fights for titles. I've followed Leicester from the time they won the league," he told LCFC TV. "I know it's not going to be easy, but I feel ready to face this new challenge. I will give my best for the club each and every day."  Daka has scored seven goals in 22 international appearances and was named the Confederation of African Football's Young Player of the Year in 2017. The 22-year-old scored 27 goals in 28 appearances last season to help RB Salzburg win their fourth successive Austrian league title. He was also named the Austrian Bundesliga's player of the season.  One bonus for Leicester is that Daka will not have to miss any of the Premier League season as Zambia failed to qualify for next January's Africa Cup of Nations finals.
