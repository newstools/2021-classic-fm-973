Following the suspension of its operations in Nigeria, microblogging app Twitter has reached out to the federal government seeking high-level discussion to resolve the issue. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this to State House Correspondents after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, at the presidential villa, Abuja, said Twitter reached out this morning seeking audience with the Federal Government.Â He insisted that the microblogging platform was suspended because it provided an avenue for people that are threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Minister listed as part of conditions that must be met even if there is a discussion with Twitter including that it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern, adding that other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram must be registered in the country. The Government Spokesman also denied that the suspension is not effective arguing that Twitter is losing money as a result of the action, calling on Nigerians to make use of other social media platforms.
