The Joint Minority Caucus of the Senate and the House of Representatives has met over the ban on Twitter by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government and restates its condemnation of the embargo as draconian and unacceptable.  In a statement Jointly signed by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Minority Leader of the Senate and Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the Joint Minority Caucus dismissed threats by the APC-led government to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using twitter and called on Nigerians to go ahead and use their twitter as they would not be contravening any law in Nigeria or any international statute.  The Joint Minority Caucus recognizes the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, which Nigeria is a signatory to, as well as provisions of Sections 39 and 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and notes that by these provisions no one will be violating any law for using twitter in Nigeria.  As lawmakers, the Joint Caucus is pained by the anguish Nigerians, especially the youths, who find the use of twitter as a means of livelihood and genuine social interaction, are passing through just because the APC-led Federal Government feels slighted that an individualâ€™s post, was deleted by Twitter for ethic violation. The joint caucus therefore call on Nigerians to use various opportunities offered by technology and continue making use of twitter since such does not violate any law in our country.
