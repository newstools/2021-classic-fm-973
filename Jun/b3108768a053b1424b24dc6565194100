The highlight of last year’s edition of World Music Day webinar was the unveiling of Gocreate App, MCSN’s breakthrough technology for effective rights management, which has registered over 7,000 active users, an unprecedented achievement in the history of CMO in Nigeria. At this year’s event, however, MCSN/Gocreate’s, Chief Technology Officer, Onome Ojigbo will present the first set of data report extracted from the monitoring of music airplay on radio stations across the country. The data analytics will give insight into the advantages and importance of data intelligence in rights management.  According to PMAN President, Pretty Okafor, it’s imperative for major stakeholders to work closely with MCSN, the nation’s only licensed CMO for music rights, to ensure smooth transition into a digital ecosystem. He noted that the partnership with Banwo and Ighodalo would allow practitioners to have more legal insight into world best practices when it comes to collective management organizations.
