...Admits all is not well in the country Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma has accused the opposition, and disgruntled politicians of passively encouraging insecurity across the country to fester.  Speaking with State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Sen. Uzodinma appealed to stakeholders in the state including traditional rulers, religious leaders, politicians, to engage more with the people to restore peace in the state as he alone cannot guarantee security in the crisis-ridden state.  Responding to Questions on the perceived defection of more People's Democratic Party(PDP) Governors to the All Progressives Congress party, the Governor declared that APC will win the 2023 elections despite deliberate attempts by some group of people to pull the current administration down.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Governor admitted that all is not well in the country, stating that those who are destroying government property must be ready to face the consequences.
