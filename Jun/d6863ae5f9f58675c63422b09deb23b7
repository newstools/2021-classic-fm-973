The Senate Tuesday received a formal request from President Muhammadu Buhari to confirm the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya.  The request was contained in a letter addressed to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and read during resumption of plenary.  President Buhari in the letter said Yahayaâ€™s appointment was in compliance with the provisions of Section 18 subsection 1 of the Armed Forces Act 2004.  The new nominee takes over from former Chief of Army Staff, Major General Attahiru Ibrahim, who died in a plane crash near the Kaduna International Airport about two weeks ago.
