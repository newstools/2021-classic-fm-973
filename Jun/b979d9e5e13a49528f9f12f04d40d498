The Federal Executive Council, FEC, Wednesday approved the resumption of the Federal Capital Development Authority, FCDA, land swap initiative which started during the Goodluck Jonathanâ€™s administration.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the initiative valued at about N1 trillion under the previous administration was aimed at addressing the infrastructure deficit in the FCT by swapping land with private investors who would in turn provide the necessary infrastructure.  Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Mr Mohammed Bello, who disclosed this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of FEC meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa, Abuja, said some amendments were made to the original form of the initiative by establishing a legal framework to protect all parties.  On his part, Minister of Works and housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola said a note was presented to the council on the worrisome increase in number of road traffic crashes on Federal highways, stating that the National Road Safety Advisory Council will be inaugurated tomorrow (Thursday) by the office of the Vice President.
