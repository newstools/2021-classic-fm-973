The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is planning to ensure the establishment of additional polling units nationwide before the 2023 general elections.  INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, speaking at the first consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja, stressed the need to expand voters' access to polling units in Nigeria, noting that there are only 120,000 polling units to serve a projected population of over 50 million voters.  Prof. Yakubu disclosed that the commission has commenced early consultations with relevant stakeholders to mitigate resistance to expanding voters' access to polling units, which was widely misunderstood and politicised in 2007, 2014 and before the 2019 General Election.  Our Correspondents, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Commission at the end of the meeting, is expected to commence the process of converting the existing Voting points(VPs) and Voting Points Settlements (VPS) nationwide into full-fledged polling units immediately, based on clearly articulated guidelines to be developed by INEC and shared with stakeholders.
