President Muhammadu Buhari has said elites in the country should be more reflective and fair in their assessment of the administration, noting that the strides recorded should be appreciated.  The President who expressed his regrets in his comments at a lunch with party leaders and Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) after revalidating his membership of the party in Katsina state over the weekend, lamented that the nation's elites have resolved continuous criticism of his administration in repositioning the country despite the plunge in revenues.Â The President also charged the party leaders and governors who are in charge of their constituencies to ensure the return of the party to the people by using the bottom-up approach.  In his remarks, the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, said the governing party had already set up two committees to ensure effectiveness in the registration and revalidation process, with Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello heading the mobilization and sensitization, while the Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, leads the registration process.
