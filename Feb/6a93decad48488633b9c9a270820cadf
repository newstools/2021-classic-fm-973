A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to unfreeze the bank accounts of the 20 #EndSARS promoters.  Justice Ahmed Mohammed who gave the ruling following the agreement reached by the legal teams of the CBN and the defendants to amicably resolve the matter, also commended the counsels to the CBN, Michael Andoaka and lawyer to the defendants, Femi Falana, ruling that "all processes filed in respect of the case are hereby deemed to have been withdrawn."  Recall that the CBN had approached the court and obtained an order to freeze the accounts of Bolatito Rachael Oduala and 19 others who received donations for the EndSARS protesters calling for an end to police brutality in the country.Â Counsel to the defendants, Mr Femi Falana spoke to journalists on the Judge's ruling on the matter.
