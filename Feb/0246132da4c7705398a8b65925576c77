A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the re-arraignment of former Abia State Governor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in an alleged seven point one billion naira (N7.1bn) money-laundering charges be put on hold pending the resolution of the legality of the retrial charges brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).  Justice Ekwo temporarily stayed the re-trial while delivering ruling in an application by Kalu seeking leave to file aÂ motion against his re-trial for alleged fraud committed when he was Governor of Abia State between 1999 to 2007.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the judge admitted that Senator Kalu who is the Senate Chief Whip had placed sufficient materials of value before the court to enable him to secure permission for judicial review of his retrial in charges in which he had been tried, convicted, and spent some months at Kuje prison in Abuja.  While speaking with journalist, the council to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Ikoro N. Ikoro stated that the court granted senator Kalu permission to apply for an order of perpetual injunction against the federal government through EFCC to prohibit his retrial so as not to be made to suffer double jeopardy.  Justice Ekwo adjourned till February 23, 2021 for mention of the substantive suit.
