The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said it is working to make the fight against COVID-19 easier for its member countries by reducing export restrictions on medical supplies and equipment.  The Director-General of the WTO, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who disclosed this today in a meeting with members of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 in Abuja stressed that in a pandemic, an economy cannot be advanced until the health sector is taken care of.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of PTF, Mr. Boss Mustapha, noted that the pandemic came with a lot of effects and impacts on the nationâ€™s economy, but provided an opportunity for the country to really go back and look at her systems.
