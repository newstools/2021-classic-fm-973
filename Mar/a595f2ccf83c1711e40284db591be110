The National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Munguno (Rtd) has declared that the federal government will adopt full force to eliminate bandits and insurgents, rather than negotiating with criminals in order to address the nation's security challenges.  Speaking at the State House Briefing in Abuja today, Monguno who noted that negotiating with criminals would portray weakness and incapability on the side of the government affirmed that local intelligence and working with local informants has been very helpful, but that response time is still problematic.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the NSA while responding to a question on the activities of Sheikh Abukabar Gunmi, said they met with the Islamic cleric in Kaduna and he offered to assist the federal government.  The NSA further disclosed that the current administration has done a lot from 2015 till date in taking out sea pirates, eliminating 2,403 insurgents and freeing 864 kidnapped persons, adding that shortage of personnel and modern equipment are major issues impeding the security efforts.  The NSA harped on the need to deploy technology to fight insecurity, saying that the recent unveiling of the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy 2021 is in that direction.
