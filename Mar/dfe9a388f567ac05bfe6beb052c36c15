President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday commissioned the headquarters building of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in Port Harcourt, 25 years after the building commenced, commending the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio, for steadfastness in ending many years of renting by the commission, and the attendant profligacy.  The President, who joined the commissioning ceremony virtually from the Council Chamber of the State House in Abuja, urged the management to commit the amounts used for renting to more rewarding benefits. The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, thanked the President for the completion of the building, promising that the nine governors under the NDDC would continue to support his bold steps in development.  In his remarks, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs noted that the completion of the NDDC building signals the President’s commitment to the development of the oil-producing region, and ending of activities of corrupt public officials, who also negated the connection of the offices to the national grid over many years in order to seek rent on fuelling of generators.
