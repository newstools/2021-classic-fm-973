Awards season kicked off in earnest on Sunday night with the 78th annual Golden Globes, and all eyes were on the ceremony that is supposed to honor excellence in film and television. For many different reasons.  The Globes were already delayed from January due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving four-time hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to emcee in the ultimate socially distanced manner — from opposite coasts. (Fey anchored from New York, while Poehler held court in Los Angeles.) While presenters appeared in person at both locations, celebrities battled through Zoom awkwardness and technical difficulties, and accepted their trophies remotely.  The controversy surrounding the ceremony was (briefly) addressed. The oft-maligned Hollywood Foreign Press Association — which oversees the event — is under new fire, as a recent Los Angeles Times investigation detailed ethical lapses and revealed that the HFPA doesn't have a single Black journalist among its 87 members. ("Tonight, while we celebrate the work of artists from around the globe, we recognize that we have our own work to do," said Helen Hoehne, an HFPA member from Germany, during the ceremony.) But where were we? Ah, right, the awards! With all sorts of Hollywood royalty in the (virtual) house, it was time once again to crown The Crown. Netflix's royal drama, which focused its fourth season on the Princess Diana era, took home four trophies: Best TV Drama and acting trophies for Gillian Anderson, Emma Corwin, and Josh O'Connor. Another Netflix drama, The Queen's Gambit, scored a pair of trophies, for Best Limited Series and an Best Actress in a Limited Series (Anya Taylor-Joy). Meanwhile, PopTV's Schitt's Creek, which swept the Emmys last fall for its farewell season, claimed two awards, for Best Comedy Series and Best Actress in a TV comedy (Catherine O'Hara).  On the film side, Nomadland about a woman (Frances McDormand) who journeys around the American West  took home two key awards: Best Motion Picture Drama and Best Director trophy for Chloé Zhao, who became only the second woman to win in that category (joining Barbra Streisand for 1983's Yentl). Soon after Fey took a shot at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's diversity problem in the opening monologue — "Soul is a beautiful Pixar animated movie where a Black man's soul is knocked out of his body and into a cat. The HFPA responded to this because they have five cat members" — Soul won Best Animated Movie (and it later scooped up a second award for its score).  And despite the lack of representation in the HFPA, several Black actors emerged victorious, including Daniel Kaluuya for Judas and the Black Messiah, John Boyega for Small Axe, and Chadwick Boseman, who triumphed posthumously for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom — an award that his wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, tearfully accepted on his behalf. And on a night when most of the favorites prevailed, acting newcomer Andra Day scored the big upset of the night, edging out stiff competition in Frances McDormand and Carey Mulligan to claim the Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama trophy for The United States vs. Billie Holiday — the first time a Black actress won in the category in 35 years.  Elsewhere, Sacha Baron Cohen had a shiny night, as Borat Subsequent Moviefilm claimed Best Motion Picture Comedy and he won an acting trophy for that movie. Jane Fonda received the Cecil B. DeMille Award, while Norman Lear was honored with the Carol Burnett Award. Mank, which entered the night with six nominations, came up blank, as did four-time nominees The Father, Promising Young Woman, Ozark, and The Undoing. Scroll down for all the winners at the Globes, including Rosamund Pike, who declared that she did indeed care a lot that she won for I Care a Lot, and hoodie-wearing Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis.
